    h1 View / Router
    ul.docs-index
    p <strong>View</strong> (&lt;div class="view"&gt;) - is a separate visual part of the app with its own settings, navigation and history. So it is some kind of app in app. Such kind of functionality allows you easily manipulate each part of your app.
    h2 View Layout
    p Let's look at view HTML structure:
    :code(lang="html")
          <body>
            <!-- app root -->
            <div id="app">
              <!-- view inside of panel -->
              <div class="panel panel-left panel-cover">
                <div class="view panel-view"> ... </div>
              </div>
              <!-- Your main view -->
              <div class="view view-main">
                <!-- View related pages -->
                ...
              </div>
              <div class="popup">
                <div class="view popup-view"> ... </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </body>
    p As you see <strong>View</strong> may be almost in any part of your app.
    h4 Main View
    p Your main view should have additional <strong>view-main</strong> class. Why we need main view? By default all links (which is not in any initialized view) will load pages in main view. Also if you use <code>pushState</code> hash navigation then it works only for main view's navigation.
    h2 Multiple Views Layout
    p In case we have the app with multiple views in app root, so called "Tabbed Views" app, we must wrap our views with additional <code>&lt;div class="views"&gt;</code> element.
    .important-note
      p Only one "Views" element is allowed!
    :code(lang="html")
          <body>
            <!-- app root -->
            <div id="app">
              <!-- view inside of panel -->
              <div class="panel panel-left panel-cover">
                <div class="view panel-view"> ... </div>
              </div>
              <!-- Views container -->
              <div class="views tabs">
                <!-- Your main view -->
                <div class="view view-main tab tab-active" id="view-1">
                  <!-- View related pages -->
                  ...
                </div>
                <!-- Another view -->
                <div class="view tab" id="view-2">
                  <!-- View related pages -->
                  ...
                </div>
                ...
              </div>
              <div class="popup">
                <div class="view popup-view"> ... </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          </body>
    h2 View App Methods
    p When we already have required views in HTML and our app is already <a href="init-app.html">initialized</a>, now we need to initialize our views. Let's look at available app methods to work with Views:
    .method-wrap
      p
        span.method app.views.create(<span>viewEl, parameters</span>)
        |  - initialize View
      ul.method-parameters
        li
          span.parameter viewEl
          |  - <span class="parameter-type">string</span> or <span class="parameter-type">HTMLElement</span>. If string - CSS selector of View element
        li
          span.parameter parameters
          |  - <span class="parameter-type">object</span>. Object with View parameters
        li.method-returns Method returns object with just created View instance.
    .method-wrap
      p
        span.method app.views.get(<span>viewEl</span>)
        |  - get View instance by HTML element
      ul.method-parameters
        li
          span.parameter viewEl
          |  - <span class="parameter-type">string</span> or <span class="parameter-type">HTMLElement</span>. If string - CSS selector of View element
        li.method-returns Method returns object with just created View instance.
    .method-wrap
      p There could be situation when we need to get currently active View, because instead of main app view we may also have view in opened popup, popover, opened panel, tabs, etc. This method allows to get the View instance of currently active/visible/"most-top" view.
      p For example, if you have initilized View in panel, and panel is currently opened, then this method will return panel's view. Or, if you use app with tab bar layout, where each tab is view, then this method will return currently active/visible tab-view
      p
        span.method app.views.current
        |  - get currently active/visible View instance.

      ul.method-parameters
        li.method-returns Method returns object with just created View instance.


    h2 View Parameters
    p Now let's look at list of available parameters we need to create View:
    table.params-table
      thead
        tr
          th Parameter

        tr
          td main
          td boolean
          td false
          td Specify whether this is View is main or not. If not passed then will be determined based on whether its element has <code>view-main</code> class or not

            p If have more complex route with params:

          td Fire event on instance
    h2 Linking Between Pages & Views
    p It may be not very comfortable to use router methods all the time to navigate between pages. In many cases we can just use <a href="link.html">links</a> to navigate between pages. And we can pass additional navigation parameters using <code>data-</code> attributes:
    :code(lang="html")
          <!-- same as router.navigate('/somepage/'); -->
          <a href="/somepage/">Some Page</a>

          <!-- same as router.navigate('/somepage/', {reloadCurrent: true, animate: false}); -->
          <a href="/somepage/" data-animate="false" data-reload-current="true">Some Page</a>

          <!-- same as router.back(); -->
          <a href="#" class="back">Go back</a>

          <!-- same as router.back('/home/', {force: true, ignoreCache: true}); -->
          <a href="/home/" data-force="true" data-ignore-cache="true" class="back">Go back</a>
    p Links default behavior:
    ul
      li If link is in inside of not initialized view then it will load page in main view
      li If link is in inside of initialized view then it will load page in this view (if other view is not specified in view's <code>linksView</code> parameter)
    p But if we need to load page in another view we can specify this view's CSS selector in link's <code>data-view</code> attribute
    :code(lang="html")
          <!-- left view -->
          <div class="view view-init view-left" data-name="left">
            ...
            <!-- will load "some-page" to main view -->
            <a href="/some-page/" data-view=".view-main">Some Page</a>
            ...
          </div>
          <!-- main view -->
          <div class="view view-init view-main">
            ...
            <!-- will load "another-page" to left view -->
            <a href="/another-page/" data-view=".view-left">Another Page</a>
            ...
          </div>

          td modalBeforeRemove
          td <span>(modalEl, modalRoute, modal)</span>
          td Event will be triggered right before routable modal will be removed from DOM and destroyed. As an argument event handler receives:
            ul
              li <code>modalEl</code> - modal HTML element
              li <code>modalRoute</code> - modal route
              li <code>modal</code> - modal instance
    h2 View Auto Initialization
    p If you don't need to use View API and your View is inside of DOM on a moment of app initialization then it can be auto initialized with just adding additional <code>view-init</code> class:
    :code(lang="html")
          <!-- Add view-init class -->
          <div class="view view-init">
            ...
          </div>
    p But what about View parameters. In this case we may pass them in <code>data-</code> attributes.
    .important-note
      p Parameters that used in camelCase, for example <code>pushState</code>, in data- attributes should be used as kebab-case as <b>data-push-state</b>
    :code(lang="html")
          &lt;!-- view parameters in data- attributes --&gt;
          &lt;div class="view view-init" data-url="/" data-name="home" data-push-state="true"&gt;
            ...
          &lt;/div&gt;
    p In this case if you need to access created View instance you can use:
    ul
      li In case if it is main view, we may use <code>app.views.main</code> to get main view instance
      li Otherwise, we can access it by passed <code>name</code> parameter like <code>app.views.home</code>
    :code(lang="html")
          <!-- main view -->
          <div class="view view-main view-init">
            ...
          </div>

          <!-- another view -->
          <div class="view view-init" data-name="home">
            ...
          </div>
    :code(lang="js")
          var mainView = app.views.main;
          var homeView = app.views.home;
    h2 Initial Page Route
    p Initial page can also be loaded correctly using <a href="routes.html">Routes</a>. In app layout we must leave View blank:
    :code(lang="html")
          <body>
            <div id="app">
              <div class="view view-main"></div>
            </div>
          </body>
    p In routes we may specify "home" route, for example:
    :code(lang="js")
          routes: [
            {
              path: '/',
              url: './home.html'
            },
            ...
          ]
    p And when we init the View, we need to specify it is default URL:
    :code(lang="js")
          app.views.create('.view-main', {
            url: '/'
          })
    p That is all, now on app load, home page content will be loaded from "home.html" file.
