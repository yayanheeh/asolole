    h1 Tap Hold Event (Long Tap)
    p Framework7 has so called "tap hold" event. It triggers (if enabled) after a sustained, complete touch event. By default it is disabled and could be enabled and configured using <code>touch.tapHold...</code> <a href="app.html#app-parameters">App parameters</a> on app initialization.

    p Note, that Tap Hold is a part of built-in <b>Fast Clicks</b> library, so Fast Clicks should be also enabled.

    p Also note, that you probably will need to disable mobile browser default "long-tap" actions by adding these CSS rules to elements:
    :code(lang="css")
          -moz-user-select: none;
          -webkit-user-select: none;
          user-select: none;

    p For example:
    :code(lang="js")
          var app = new Framework7({
            touch: {
              tapHold: true //enable tap hold events
            },
          });

          var $$ = Dom7;

          $$('.some-link').on('taphold', function () {
            app.dialog.alert('Tap hold fired!');
          });
