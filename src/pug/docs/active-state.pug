    h1 Active State
    p Framework7 uses so called "active state" to highlight links and buttons when you tap them. It is done to make F7 app behave like native app, not like a web app.
    p Active state is a part of built-in <b>Fast Clicks</b> library, so Fast Clicks should be also enabled.
    p It works almost in the same way as CSS <code>:active</code> selector, it adds <code>active-state</code> class to links and buttons when you tap them. The only difference is that it adds this class after small time interval, this prevents false highlights during page scrolling.
    p So when you write your CSS styles you should write active states like:
    :code(lang="css")
          /* Usual state */
          .my-button {
              color: red;
          }
          /* Active/tapped state */
          .my-button.active-state {
              color: blue;
          }
