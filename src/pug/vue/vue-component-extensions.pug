    h1 Vue Component Extensions
    p <b>After</b> Vue mounts the app and init Framework7, we will have access to Framework7's initialized instance and some other useful properties that will be available in all Vue components:
    table.methods-table
      tbody
        tr
          td this.$f7ready
          td Callback function that will be executed when Framework7 fully intialized. Useful to use in components when you need to access Framework7 API and to be sure it is ready. So it is safe to put all Framework7 related logic into this callback. As an argument it receives initialized Framework7 instance. For example:
            :code(lang="html")
                  <template>
                    ...
                  </template>
                  <script>
                    export default {
                      ...
                      mounted() {
                        this.$f7ready((f7) => {
                          f7.dialog.alert('Component mounted');
                        });
                      },
                    };
                  </script>
        tr
          td this.$f7
          td Main Framework7's initialized instance. It allows you to use any of Framework7 APIs
        tr
          td this.$$<br>this.Dom7

          td
            p.important-note This property only available for components loaded with router (e.g. pages, routable modals, routable tabs). If you need to access this property in "deeper" child components, then you need to pass it down using props.
            p Framework7 Router Instance. It has a lot of useful <a href="../docs/view.html#router-api-methods-properties">Methods & Properties</a> to use for navigation
        tr
          td this.$f7route
          td
            p.important-note This property only available for components loaded with router (e.g. pages, routable modals, routable tabs). If you need to access this property in "deeper" child components, then you need to pass it down using props.
            p Object with current route data that was used to load this page, tab or modal. It has the following properties

              li <code>params</code> - route params. If we have matching route with <code>/page/user/:userId/post/:postId/</code> path and url of the page is <code>/page/user/55/post/12/</code> then it will be the following object <code>{userId: '55', postId: '12'}</code>
