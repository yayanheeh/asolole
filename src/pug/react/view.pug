    h1 View React Component
    ul.docs-index
    p <b>View</b> - is a separate visual part of app with its own settings, navigation and history. Each view also may have different navbar and toolbar layouts, different styles. So it is some kind of app in app. Such kind of functionality allows you easily manipulate each part of your app.
    p View React component represents Framework7's <a href="../docs/view.html">View</a> component.

    h2 View Components
    p There are following components included:
    ul
      li <code><b>View</b></code> / <code><b>F7View</b></code> - single View-router component

    h2 Access To View Instance
    p If you use automatic initalization to init the View (with <code>init={true}</code> prop) and need to use <a href="../docs/view.html">View API</a> (like router) you can access its initialized instance:
    ul
      li by accessing <code><b>.f7View</b></code> component's property
      li if you have passed <b>name</b> property (e.g. "left") you can access it like <code>this.$f7.views.left</code>
      li main view (with <b>main={true}</b> prop) is always accessible via <code>this.$f7.views.main</code>
